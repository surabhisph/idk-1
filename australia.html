        <p> The Great Barrier Reef is not only Australia's largest coral reef system, but also the worlds. It streches over 2,300
          kilometers which is about 1,400 miles. It is world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef is made
          out of coral polyps. Although the reef is collapsing due to plastics, a very big part of the GBR is being protected by
          the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The GBR is facing a lot of threats along with golbal warming, water pollution, and 
          pesticides. This can be stopped. The way that we can stop this is by stop polluting the oceans, stop using plastic, and 
          stop polluting the air because that is what causes global warming.</p>
        <p> The Great Barrier is home to more than 1,500 fish species. For example,  the clownfish, red bass, red-throat 
          emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout. Forty-nine species mass spawn, while eighty-four other
          species spawn elsewhere in their range. Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm 
          waters up to 50 metres deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section. None found in
          the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any endangered. </p>
