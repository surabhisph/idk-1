  <p>The pyramids are huge tombs for pharaohs and nobility. Pharaohs are kings or queens. The Egyptians believed that dead people’s spirits could live after death if their bodies were carefully preserved. It was especially important to preserve a pharaoh’s bodies because their spirit would help Egypt’s kingdom to survive. The slaves make dead bodies into mummies and, buried them in these excellent tombs along with spices, clothes, jewels and things they need for afterlife. 
The first pyramid was built between 2630 and 2611 BC. It was built for King Djoser. Before that, pharaohs (kings or queens) were buried in flat-mounds called mastabas. The last pyramid in Egypt was built around 1530 BC. Thousands of egyptians worked in the hot sun to clear the site, lay the foundations, drag building stone from the quarry and lift it in place. Most of the  egyptians were ordinary farmers,who worked as builders to pay their duty to the pharaohs. Expert craftsmen cut the stones into blocks and fitted them together to make a pyramid. When the pyramid was almost finished casing blocks of white limestone were laid on top of the main pyramid blocks. Each casing block was carefully trimmed so that the outers surface of the pyramid would be smooth and white. The casing blocks from the Great Pyramid of Giza were removed in the 14th and 15th centuries and were used to build the city of Cairo(Egypt's capital). Some casing blocks still remain on the top of the pyramid next to Khufu's pyramid(belonging to Khafra's pyramid. </p>
  <p> Did you know that The Great Sphinx is a pyramid made of one mound of rock except The Great Sphinx has a head of a pharaoh and a body of a lion. It is located in Giza where it guards the front of ceremonial pyramid.Legends have been told about The Great Sphinx for many years. Some people even believe that there are hidden passages or rooms underneath The Great Sphinx but, nothing has been found yet. 
The beginning of one story about The Great Sphinx tells about is written on a stele/stelai(stone slabs) that would  stand upright in a temple or a important place. Important information recorded on the stelai. The singular of the stelai is stele. The story reads that one day a young prince fell asleep next to the Sphinx. He had been hunting all day, and was very tired. He dreamt that the Great Sphinx that he would become ruler of upper and lower Egypt if he cleared the sand covering the Sphinx’s its body (the Great Sphinx was covered with sand up to its neck). The rest of the story is gone, so you will have to use your imagination to work out the ending. This stele was put up by Thutmosis also known as King Tut IV who lived around 1400 BC. Did you know that Egypt is one of the most driest counties in the world?! Don't forget to read the next chapter. 
Did you know that desert covers more than 90% of Egypt and the climate is very, very hot and dry. </p>
