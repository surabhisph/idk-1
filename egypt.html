           <p>The pyramids are huge tombs for pharaohs and nobility. Pharaohs are kings or queens. The Egyptians believed that dead people’s spirits could live after death if their bodies were carefully preserved. It was especially important to preserve a pharaoh’s bodies because their spirit would help Egypt’s kingdom to survive. The slaves make dead bodies into mummies and, buried them in these excellent tombs along with spices, clothes, jewels and things they need for afterlife. 
The first pyramid was built between 2630 and 2611 BC. It was built for King Djoser. Before that, pharaohs (kings or queens) were buried in flat-mounds called mastabas. The last pyramid in Egypt was built around 1530 BC. Thousands of egyptians worked in the hot sun to clear the site, lay the foundations, drag building stone from the quarry and lift it in place. Most of the  egyptians were ordinary farmers,who worked as builders to pay their duty to the pharaohs. Expert craftsmen cut the stones into blocks and fitted them together to make a pyramid. When the pyramid was almost finished casing blocks of white limestone were laid on top of the main pyramid blocks. Each casing block was carefully trimmed so that the outers surface of the pyramid would be smooth and white. The casing blocks from the Great Pyramid of Giza were removed in the 14th and 15th centuries and were used to build the city of Cairo(Egypt's capital). Some casing blocks still remain on the top of the pyramid next to Khufu's pyramid(belonging to Khafra's pyramid. </p>

                <figcaption> The Sphinx </figcaption>
              </figure>
          
            <p> Did you know that The Great Sphinx is a pyramid made of one mound of rock except The Great Sphinx has a head of a pharaoh and a body of a lion. It is located in Giza where it guards the front of ceremonial pyramid.Legends have been told about The Great Sphinx for many years. Some people even believe that there are hidden passages or rooms underneath The Great Sphinx but, nothing has been found yet. 
The beginning of one story about The Great Sphinx tells about is written on a stele/stelai(stone slabs) that would  stand upright in a temple or a important place. Important information recorded on the stelai. The singular of the stelai is stele. The story reads that one day a young prince fell asleep next to the Sphinx. He had been hunting all day, and was very tired. He dreamt that the Great Sphinx that he would become ruler of upper and lower Egypt if he cleared the sand covering the Sphinx’s its body (the Great Sphinx was covered with sand up to its neck). The rest of the story is gone, so you will have to use your imagination to work out the ending. This stele was put up by Thutmosis also known as King Tut IV who lived around 1400 BC. Did you know that Egypt is one of the most driest counties in the world?! Don't forget to read the next chapter. 
Did you know that desert covers more than 90% of Egypt and the climate is very, very hot and dry. </p>
  <p> The Nile River: Egyptian civilizations was poor, but thanks  to the Nile River, which flooded every year bringing rich, black silt to the farmer’s crops and fields. The desert beyond this strip of farmland was called the “Red Land.” The Nile river was Egypt’s main highway. Boats were used for transporting everything from grain and cattle to blocks of granite taken from quarries. Ceremonial ships made out of cedar wood were used transport state officials and the pharaohs coffin. In 1954 a boat made for King Khufu was discovered in a pit next to the Great Pyramid. Built around 4,500 years ago the ceremonial barge was 142 feet(43) long and was probably intended for King Khufu’s journey with the Sun-god which is called Ra in afterlife.  
Farmers dug channel (tunnels) to Egypts great cities lay on the Nile river, which was also used for carrying people, goods, and foods. Lots of Egyptians used to ride boats and, still do. Egyptians ride boats for many things. Sometimes for food, trade, and other stuff,or maybe just for fun. The Nile can be very helpful in Egypt’s dry desert. In Egypt, some Egyptians used fishing nets to catch fish in the Nile river. The Egyptians lived on the a strip on each side of the Nile. 
Early boats were made out of papyrus. Papyrus are reeds. Later boats and ships were made out of wood. Thorlteyerdhal sailed his papyrus ship"RA" from Egypt to USA(United States of America), showing 
that a papyrus at could survive an ocean crossing. Skiffs are made out of bundles of papyrus reeds tied together with twine. They are propelled with two(2) oarsmen and are linked by a net edged with floats. Papyrus can also be made into sandals and paper. Egyptians were one of the first people to invent paper.</p>
  <p> Cool Facts: Egyptians got medals just like us, except the medals were shaped like a fly (bee.) 
Egyptians treated cats nice or kind. They believed that cats would scare away snakes. Cats were like pets to Egyptians. Scarabs are beetles. Scarabs collect animals dung and roll them into little balls. To the Egyptians the balls looked like life-giving sun. So they hoped that scarabs would bring them a long life. The Egyptians wrote Hieroglyphics. Scribes(writers) usually wrote Hieroglyphics from right to left. But sometimes it's read from left to right. If you see the owl facing left you know that it is supposed to be read from left to right. Did you know that some Egyptians didn't wear clothes? Children didn't wear clothes until they were teens. A pharaoh, Pepi II always kept slaves naked covered with honey because didn't want any flies to get on him.</p>
