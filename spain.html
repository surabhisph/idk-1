          <p> Spanish is known for many things. For example, their architecture, their stuctures, their art, and their beautiful landscapes. They have many astonishing beaches and many cool museums. Their museums incorporate architecture, scultupres, paintings on canvas, statues, 3rd paintings and replicas of other statues. There are many musuems dedicated just to one type of art such as a art museum or a sculptre museum. </p>

          <p>Spain is also known for its structures. One stucture is a twisted community which makes a regular house looks like a different shape than all the others, as shown to the left. There are also many churches that anyone may visit to honor their god, or just to see the sunrays through the sun rays shine on the statues and paintings inside. There are stone towers to climb and see whats on top, and there are many wonders underneath the tall chapels of pictures. </p>
